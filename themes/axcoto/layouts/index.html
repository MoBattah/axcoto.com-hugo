  <h3 class="ta-center" id="about">About me</h3>
  <p>
    I am Vinh, a self-taught programmer, 3x dad, and a bad husband because I spend most of my time writing code. I was lucky to have such wife. Recently I started to spend time holding my baby, the best thing I have ever created.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like programming and write code almost everyday, not all code is good. It's just a thing that I do everyday because I just love to do it.

  I like the act of writing code, because I think it's the easiest thing I can produce as a human being. I'm building a SAAS product, writeing a book, and contributing to some open source projects, as well as write tutorials for some magazine. If you like my work, you can <a href="/#service">hire me</a>.
